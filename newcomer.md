Welcome to SIGPwny! We are glad that you found us, and we hope you are ready to start hacking! Outlined here are a bunch of resources to get started.


1. Join our discord here, at [sigpwny.com/discord]({{ site.discord_link }}) to talk with members of the club. Once you are there, read `#rules` and `#announcements` for any recent info.

2. Flip through this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS5JNWruhT_eSwIvpz8QQACQrh8LTjDXTzIpRb_HaDvDbQk26XQHXfG5T3uoR2iAUd2d_99DMTGdbEw/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)!


Our second meeting of the year will generally be "[Introduction to Shells](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pYxPmQfwHzAjbGTjpbhWmjaU6jC2EtJzrGei7NCTCAg)". 
If you're joining us after that, please learn what a shell is and make sure you have a bash one on your computer.


Here are some other learning resources for getting started:
