# boxing-meetings
All meetings have 15m presentations, followed by an activity. We want to
wrap these up in a packaged format so we can publish them, get cred for the
club, and reuse them in future years.

Your task is to copy a template and fill it with content, then send it to
the website admin. You can also preview how it'll look on the website
locally.

**The audience** is an upperclassman and an underclassman running the meeting.
The upperclassman will send the underclassman the link to the page and ask them
to solve the challenges ahead of time. The upperclassman will also read the "topics"
section as a method of concisely communicating the learn objectives.

### Jekyll Details (don't read unless you're website admin)

* New packaged meetings (`meeting_name.md`) go into `_meetings` dir, copy
`EXAMPLE.md` and set jekyll front matter appropriately
* Use `layout: meeting`. Meetings use a [jekyll layout](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/).
* meetings are a jekyll
"[collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/)", if you need more
info about how they actually work / need to do design work.
