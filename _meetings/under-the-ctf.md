Challenges are hosted [here](https://underthectf.com/challenges/) (and should be on github if it ever goes down, google for them.)

See the slides for a description of how to circumvent textsheet.com. This is designed to be a practical, useful-for-students-daily application of the things we learn in SIGPwny.
