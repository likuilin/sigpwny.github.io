[Here's a useful link that details how to get into graph mode](http://klatz.co/ctf-blog/r2-graph-mode).

This meeting will cover some basics of r2 and tmux. r2 is a reverse engineering tool that enables us to do analysis on programs. This is essential for reverse engineering. tmux is a great way to run terminal windows in the background, run multiple windows at once, and more!
