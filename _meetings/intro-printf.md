goal: "Learn the basics of exploiting format string attacks"
how-to-run: [
	"This concept is best explained with first explaining a little, and then introducing a challenge",
	"First talk about how printf works, then give a simple challenge, then introduce more advanced concepts, etc.",
	"The challenges should begin with simply using %s to print a string, then using %x a few times to see the stack, then $n%x to print a specific offset, and finally using %n to overwrite information.",
]
list-of-topics: [
	"%x: print hex",
	"%d: print decimal",
	"%s: print string given pointer to string on stack",
	"%n: store number of characters printed thus far into a pointer on the stack",
	"reversing",
	"pwn"

This week's meeting will be covering format string vulnerabilities in the C printf function. If a program allows you to specify a format string argument to a printf call, you can do all sorts of stuff, from redirecting program flow to overwritting arbitrary memory locations!
