# Game Hacking
This meeting is about hacking games. We will be using an FPS Game to demonstrate so bring your **mouse** in order to make playing the game easier! Make sure to download Cheat Engine for this meeting. As of now, the buffer overflow attack and format string attack only are supported on the Mac binary. **Note: MacOS plans to discontinue support for 32 bit apps. In the future, AssaultCube will not work on Macs.** Also, the health challenge needs to be fixed.
