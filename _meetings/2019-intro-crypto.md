goal: "Teach the Basics of two common cryptography methods: XOR and RSA"
how-to-run: [
	"Teach XOR, start by going over one bit of XOR, then XOR two characters (have the binary ready), then teach single and repeated key XOR",
	"Help people do a basic XOR challenge",
	"Teach the basics of RSA, those who are ready to do RSA can problably continue, otherwise just keep helping with XOR"
]
list-of-topics: [
	"Cryptography",
	"XOR encryption",
	"RSA encryption"
	]

Tonight we will be doing a meeting on Basic Cryptography, We will cover XOR and RSA. Both of these are complicated, but can be described in less than a few sentences!
