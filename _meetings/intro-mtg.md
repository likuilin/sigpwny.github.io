<!-- This is the format for every single meeting. For boxers: all information can go
into the "front matter" above, between the three backslashes. -->


For this meeting, we set up and run our internal CTF (running CTFd on a
DigitalOcean server, can be migrated to our own server when it's up)  ahead
of time. We described what the club is, along with our goals for the
semester, and our promise to have meetings be hands-on and well-guided. We
promised to not waste attendees' time, with a strict 15m talking / 45m
doing constraint.
