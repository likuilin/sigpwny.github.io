This meeting is structured a little differently than other ones: the challenges are meant to encourage you to secure your digital accounts and start applying lessons learned in the meeting. The meeting covers the basics of how to not get pwned, whether your threat model is state-funded agencies or just avoiding getting phished by email malware. It'll cover a wide spectrum of threat models: from strategies used by CIA operatives and chief information security officers (CISOs) to strategies that are useful for students at UIUC.
