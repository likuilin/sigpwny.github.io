For this meeting, we described how the web worked through servers and clients. We introduced OWASP's top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g. cross-site scripting) and warned against unauthorized access to servers. The rest of the time was spent either playing Gruyere, a codelab created by Google that walks through different web vulnerabilities, or OverTheWire's Natas, which teaches web security through a series of games. Gruyere does an excellent job of naming, explaining, and demonstrating different kinds of web vulnerabilities. It also walks through how to fix them.
