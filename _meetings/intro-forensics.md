### How to gain more skill:
- Practice makes perfect
- Learning tools Like Foremost, Wireshark, and Stegsolve
- Learn about networking
- Learn everything you possibly can about files
- Do the CTF challeges availible for forensics (I.E PicoCTF and [this List of CTFs](https://aboutdfir.com/challenges-ctfs/))
- Learn how to use Python as a tool for image manipulation, opening/handling files
- Practice Steganography - both sides of it
